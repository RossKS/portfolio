          <h3>Tenancy Applications</h3>
          <p>Tenancy Applications are assessed based on satisfactory responses to enquiries about the applicants credit history. In addition, employers, bank and personal references will also be required to support the tenants application. In some
            circumstances, a guarantor may be required in order that the tenants application is acceptable.</p>
          <p>Credit history information is provided by specialised agencies who charge Firstview Lettings for this information. The charge for checking the applicants credit history is included in the <b>Application Fee</b>.</p>
          <p>Both tenant and landlord will be required to enter into an Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement with each other and which will be prepared by Firstview Lettings Ltd. Typically, such agreements have an initial minimum fixed term of 6
            months duration. The preparation of an Inventory Schedule itemising the condition of the fixtures and fittings within the property is strongly recommended.</p>
          <p><b>Initial Payment</b> The tenant cannot be given the keys to a property for which a tenancy application is successful until the initial payment due to the landlord has been received by Firstview Lettings and has been cleared through the
            banking system. The initial payment is an amount equal to the first months rent plus a deposit bond of six weeks rent. The bond will be held by the Landlord as security against exceptional wear and tear or dilapidations in the condition
            of the property over the let period for which the tenant is responsible, and/or any other costs incurred by the Landlord which are the tenants responsibility under the agreement.</p>

          <h3>Tenant Introduction Services</h3>
          <p>Tenants for properties featured on the Firstview Lettings website will be identified primarily via this website. Other methods of advertising, such as newspaper adverts may be used from time to time but the intention of such advertising
            methods is to promote the existence of this website only, and not necessarily to advertise individual featured properties. Our <b>charge</b> therefore reflects the cost of providing this type of service.</p>
          <p> Firstview Lettings will act as a matchmaker and will connect tenants looking for homes to rent with landlords which have properties that meet the tenants requirements.</p>
